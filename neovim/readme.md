# NeoVIM

This editor is kind of insane. It's not really an editor as much as it is a platform to build a custom editor on top of. As such, I have tried to keep it as simple as possible:

* No package manager - just Git submodules in my Dotfiles
* As few plugins as possible - only whats needed to modernize Vim
* Use built-in where possible - some of these are hard to configure, so help is allowed
* No plugins that setup too much - if external dependencies are needed, install them manually
