# Ranger

The CLI [file-manager](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

## Configuration

It's kept very small with just some changes made to the default config.
As such, it's meant to be used _on top_ of the default, meaning `RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC` should **NOT** be set to `false`.

## Dependencies

There are **no required** external dependencies, but some tools can help:

* [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for syntax highlight in previews - see config!
